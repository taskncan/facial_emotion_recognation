Facial Emotion Recognition System

This is a facial emotion recognition system that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze facial expressions in images or video. It can detect and classify various emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and so on.

Requirements

* Python 3.11 or latest 
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Numpy

Installation 

Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/taskncan/facial_emotion_recognation.git

Limitations

The system is trained on a limited dataset and may not perform well on images or videos of people with diverse skin tones or facial features.
The system is only able to detect the following emotions: Happy, sad, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, neutral.

Future Work

We plan to increase the diversity of the training data to improve performance on a diverse set of faces.
We also plan to add support for more emotions in the future.
